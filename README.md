My honors thesis which was in the math department gave a survey modern day factoring and primality algorithms and the mathematics that went into them. This has clear connections to cryptography but is interesting in its own right. In particular, I thought that the quadratic sieve and number field sieve are particularly interesting because of all the different areas of math they pull in with the connection between linear algebra and factoring an integer being the most surprising connection to me.
